"""
@file inference.py
@brief Contains the core logic for validating and solving Einstein's Riddle.

This module includes:
- A function to check if a given house arrangement satisfies all constraints of the riddle.
- A function to find all valid solutions using a brute-force approach.

@details The validation function ensures compliance with all clues from the riddle, such as the positions of houses,
occupants, pets, drinks, and cigarettes. The solving function iterates through all possible permutations of attributes,
filtering out invalid combinations to find solutions.

    @brief Validates a house arrangement against the rules of Einstein's Riddle.

    @details This function checks whether a given configuration of houses satisfies all the riddle's constraints.
    Each rule corresponds to a specific clue from the riddle, and assertions are used to validate the rules.

    color, nationality, drink, cigarette, and pet.

    @return True if the arrangement satisfies all rules; otherwise, returns a string indicating
    the category of the failed rule (e.g., "color", "nationalities", "drinks", "cigarettes", or "pets").
