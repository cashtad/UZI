@brief Provides the foundational data and utility functions for solving Einstein's Riddle.

This module includes:
- Predefined sets of possible attribute values for houses.
- A utility function to generate all permutations of these attributes for use in solving the riddle.

@details The predefined attributes (colors, nationalities, drinks, cigarettes, and pets) represent the constraints
of the riddle. The function `get_all_combinations` generates all possible arrangements of these attributes,
which serve as the basis for finding valid solutions.
